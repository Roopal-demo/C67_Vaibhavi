once there lived a little boy in the village who used to shout fox to scare the villagers.
When he fisrt did this, all the villagers got scared and gathered at a place where the boy was.
They asked him where is the fox.
The boy did the same thing the next day also.
Villagers got irritated & did not bother about him.
